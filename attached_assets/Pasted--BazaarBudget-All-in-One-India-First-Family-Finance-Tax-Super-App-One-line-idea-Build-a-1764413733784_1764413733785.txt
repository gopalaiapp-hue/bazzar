# BazaarBudget – All-in-One India-First Family Finance & Tax Super App  
**One-line idea:** Build a zero-effort, vernacular, family-shared money app that auto-tracks cash + bank + UPI, splits expenses intelligently, and files complex ITR (salary + freelance + rental + capital gains + agriculture) in one tap — so middle-class Indians finally stop living paycheck-to-paycheck and stop paying ₹10k–20k to CAs.
